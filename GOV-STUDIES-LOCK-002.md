# GOV-STUDIES-LOCK-002: Verify & Lock Normalized Studies Registry

**Status:** Ready for Execution
**Priority:** High
**Assignee:** Cursor (auto-generated)
**Created:** 2025-11-05

## 🎯 Objective

Verify the normalized studies registry achieves 100% coverage and lock it with governance controls.

## 📋 Tasks

### 1. Run Governance Checks
```bash
# Execute governance monitor
python scripts/governance_monitor.py --check

# Run coverage gate (minimum 80%)
./tools/quality/coverage_gate.sh --min 0.80
```

### 2. Verify Study Coverage
- [ ] Confirm all 19 studies (ST-001 through ST-019) are present
- [ ] Validate checksum integrity for all canonical files
- [ ] Ensure aliases point to correct canonical paths
- [ ] Check cross-references in matrix are accurate

### 3. Lock Registry Implementation
- [ ] Add `revision` field to `governance/studies/registry.json`
- [ ] Implement RFC requirement for canonical path changes
- [ ] Add CI/CD validation for registry integrity
- [ ] Update governance framework to reference locked registry

### 4. Clean Migration Path
- [ ] Mark deprecated alias files for removal
- [ ] Update all documentation references
- [ ] Validate no broken links after normalization

## ✅ Success Criteria

- **Coverage**: 100% study coverage verified
- **Integrity**: All checksums match canonical files
- **Governance**: Registry locked with RFC controls
- **CI/CD**: Automated validation passes
